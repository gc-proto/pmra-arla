<h1>Test concepts</h1>

  <p>The following is a list of possible "concepts" that we are exploring and looking to get feedback on. These are not finalized designs, and nothing here should be seen as a commitment to delivery.</p>
</section>

<p>As part of PMRA Transformation, we are looking to improve the digital products and services that people use when interacting with Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency.</p>
<p>One way we do that is through user research and design. We talk with different users to understand what they are trying to do in their interactions with the PMRA, and where they struggle. We then design possible solutions, and then test them out to ensure they're an improvement over the existing solution.</p>


<h3>Focus on Transparency</h3>
<p>The following concepts are primarily related to "transparency": how the PMRA shares data and information. This relates to the access of data holdings,  communicating how decisions are made, and the science behind the decisions.</p>

<h3>Concepts</h3>
